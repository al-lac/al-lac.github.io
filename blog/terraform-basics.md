# Beginners Guide to Terraform

Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to manage and provision cloud resources using declarative configuration files. In this beginner guide, we'll walk you through getting started with Terraform and show you how to set up and manage your first project.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have:

- A basic understanding of command-line interfaces
- An active account with a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Installation

To install Terraform, follow the instructions for your operating system:

- [Windows](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)
- [macOS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)
- [Linux](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)

Verify the installation by running:

```shell
terraform -version
```

## Setting up your first project

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```shell
mkdir terraform-project && cd terraform-project
```

2. Create a main.tf file:

```shell
touch main.tf
```

3. Open the `main.tf` file and configure your provider. For example, if you're using AWS, your configuration would look like this:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

## Initializing Terraform

1. In your project directory, run:

```shell
terraform init
```

This command initializes your Terraform project and downloads the necessary provider plugins.

## Creating a resource

1. In the `main.tf` file, define a resource. For example, to create an AWS S3 bucket:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"
  acl = "private"
}
```

2. Save the file.

## Applying changes

1. Run the following command to review the changes Terraform will apply:

```shell
terraform plan
```

2. To apply the changes, run:

```shell
terraform apply
```

3. Confirm the changes by typing `yes` and pressing Enter.

## Destroying resources

1. To destroy the resources you've created, run:

```shell
terraform destroy
```

2. Confirm the destruction of resources by typing yes and pressing Enter. This will remove the resources you've created using Terraform.
